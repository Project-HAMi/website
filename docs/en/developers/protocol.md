## Protocol Implementation

### Device Registration

HAMi needs to know the spec of each AI devices in the cluster in order to schedule properly. During device registration, device-plugin needs to keep patching the spec of each device into node annotations every 30 seconds, in the format of the following:

```
hami.io/node-handshake-\{device-type\}: Reported_\{device_node_current_timestamp\}
hami.io/node-\{deivce-type\}-register: \{Device 1\}:\{Device2\}:...:\{Device N\}
```

The definiation of each device is in the following format:
```
\{Device UUID\},\{device split count\},\{device memory limit\},\{device core limit\},\{device type\},\{device numa\},\{healthy\}
```

An example is shown below:
```
hami.io/node-handshake-nvidia: Reported 2024-01-23 04:30:04.434037031 +0000 UTC m=+1104711.777756895
hami.io/node-handshake-mlu: Requesting_2024.01.10 04:06:57
hami.io/node-mlu-register: MLU-45013011-2257-0000-0000-000000000000,10,23308,0,MLU-MLU370-X4,0,false:MLU-54043011-2257-0000-0000-000000000000,10,23308,0,
hami.io/node-nvidia-register: GPU-00552014-5c87-89ac-b1a6-7b53aa24b0ec,10,32768,100,NVIDIA-Tesla V100-PCIE-32GB,0,true:GPU-0fc3eda5-e98b-a25b-5b0d-cf5c855d1448,10,32768,100,NVIDIA-Tesla V100-PCIE-32GB,0,true:

```

In this example, this node has two different AI devices, 2 Nvidia-V100 GPUs, and 2 Cambircon 370-X4 MLUs

Note that a device node may become unavailable due to hardware or network failure, if a node hasn't registered in last 5 minutes, scheduler will mark that node as 'unavailable'.

Since system clock on scheduler node and 'device' node may not align properly, scheduler node will patch the following device node annotations every 30s

```
hami.io/node-handshake-\{device-type\}: Requesting_{scheduler_node_current_timestamp}
```
