title: Scheduler Policy 
---

## Summary

Current in a cluster with many GPU nodes, nodes are not `binpack` or `spread` when making scheduling decisions, nor are GPU cards `binpack` or `spread` when using vGPU.

## Proposal

We add a `node-scheduler-policy` and `gpu-scheduler-policy` to config, then scheduler to use this policy can impl node `binpack` or `spread` or GPU `binpack` or `spread` or `topology-aware`. The `topology-aware` policy only takes effect with Nvidia GPUs.

User can set Pod annotation to change this default policy, use `hami.io/node-scheduler-policy` and `hami.io/gpu-scheduler-policy` to overlay scheduler config.

### User Stories

This is a GPU cluster, having two node, the following story takes this cluster as a prerequisite.

![scheduler-policy-story.png](../resources/scheduler-policy-story.png)

#### Story 1

node binpack, use one node’s GPU card whenever possible, egs:
- cluster resources:
  - node1: GPU having 4 GPU device
  - node2: GPU having 4 GPU device

- request:
  - pod1: User 1 GPU
  - pod2: User 1 GPU

- scheduler result:
  - pod1: scheduler to node1
  - pod2: scheduler to node1

#### Story 2

node spread, use GPU cards from different nodes as much as possible, egs:

- cluster resources:
    - node1: GPU having 4 GPU device
    - node2: GPU having 4 GPU device

- request:
    - pod1: User 1 GPU
    - pod2: User 1 GPU

- scheduler result:
    - pod1: scheduler to node1
    - pod2: scheduler to node2

#### Story 3

GPU binpack, use the same GPU card as much as possible, egs:

- cluster resources:
    - node1: GPU having 4 GPU device, they are GPU1,GPU2,GPU3,GPU4

- request:
    - pod1: User 1 GPU, gpucore is 20%, gpumem-percentage is 20% 
    - pod2: User 1 GPU, gpucore is 20%, gpumem-percentage is 20%

- scheduler result:
    - pod1: scheduler to node1, select GPU1 this device
    - pod2: scheduler to node1, select GPU1 this device

#### Story 4

GPU spread, use different GPU cards when possible, egs:

- cluster resources:
    - node1: GPU having 4 GPU device, they are GPU1,GPU2,GPU3,GPU4

- request:
    - pod1: User 1 GPU, gpucore is 20%, gpumem-percentage is 20%
    - pod2: User 1 GPU, gpucore is 20%, gpumem-percentage is 20%

- scheduler result:
    - pod1: scheduler to node1, select GPU1 this device
    - pod2: scheduler to node1, select GPU2 this device

## Design Details

### Node-scheduler-policy

![node-scheduler-policy-demo.png](../resources/node-scheduler-policy-demo.png)

#### Binpack

Binpack mainly considers node resource usage. The more full the usage, the higher the score.

```
score: ((request + used) / allocatable) * 10 
```

1. Binpack scoring information for Node 1 is as follows

```
Node1 score: ((1+3)/4) * 10= 10
```

2. Binpack scoring information for Node 2 is as follows

```
Node2 score: ((1+2)/4) * 10= 7.5
```

So, in `Binpack` policy we can select `Node1`.

#### Spread

Spread mainly considers node resource usage. The less it is used, the lower the score, but the higher the priority.

```
score: ((request + used) / allocatable) * 10 
```

1. Spread scoring information for Node 1 is as follows
```
Node1 score: ((1+3)/4) * 10= 10
```

2. Spread scoring information for Node 2 is as follows
```
Node2 score: ((1+2)/4) * 10= 7.5
```

So, in `Spread` policy we can select `Node2`.

### GPU-scheduler-policy

![gpu-scheduler-policy-demo.png](../resources/gpu-scheduler-policy-demo.png)

#### Binpack

Binpack mainly focuses on the computing power and video memory usage of each card. The more it is used, the higher the score.
```
score: ((request.core + used.core) / allocatable.core + (request.mem + used.mem) / allocatable.mem)) * 10
```

1. Binpack scoring information for GPU 1 is as follows
```
GPU1 Score: ((20+10)/100 + (1000+2000)/8000)) * 10 = 6.75
```

2. Binpack scoring information for GPU 2 is as follows
```
GPU2 Score: ((20+70)/100 + (1000+6000)/8000)) * 10 = 17.75
```

So, in `Binpack` policy we can select `GPU2`.

#### Spread

Spread mainly focuses on the computing power and video memory usage of each card. The less it is used, the higher the score.
```
score: ((request.core + used.core) / allocatable.core + (request.mem + used.mem) / allocatable.mem)) * 10
```

1. Spread scoring information for GPU 1 is as follows
```
GPU1 Score: ((20+10)/100 + (1000+2000)/8000)) * 10 = 6.75
```

2. Spread scoring information for GPU 2 is as follows
```
GPU2 Score: ((20+70)/100 + (1000+6000)/8000)) * 10 = 17.75
```

So, in `Spread` policy we can select `GPU1`.

#### Topology-aware  

##### Nvidia Topology-aware (Nvidia GPU Only)  

Nvidia Topology-aware primarily focuses on the topological relationships between each GPU (queried using the `nvidia-smi topo -m` command). The hami-device-plugin calculates scores between GPUs based on these relationships—the higher the bandwidth between GPUs, the higher the score. For example:  

```json  
[  
  {  
    "uuid": "gpu0",  
    "score": {  
      "gpu1": "100",  
      "gpu2": "100",  
      "gpu3": "200"  
    }  
  },  
  {  
    "uuid": "gpu1",  
    "score": {  
      "gpu0": "100",  
      "gpu2": "200",  
      "gpu3": "100"  
    }  
  },  
  {  
    "uuid": "gpu2",  
    "score": {  
      "gpu0": "100",  
      "gpu1": "200",  
      "gpu3": "200"  
    }  
  },  
  {  
    "uuid": "gpu3",  
    "score": {  
      "gpu0": "200",  
      "gpu1": "100",  
      "gpu2": "200"  
    }  
  }  
]  
```  
###### One GPU
When a Pod requests only one GPU, the GPU with the worst communication performance with other GPUs is prioritized—the lower the score, the higher the scheduling priority. For example:  

1. The sum of scores for gpu0 with other GPUs is as follows:  
```  
gpu0 score: 100 + 100 + 200 = 400  
```  
2. The sum of scores for gpu1 with other GPUs is as follows:  
```  
gpu1 score: 100 + 200 + 100 = 400  
```  
3. The sum of scores for gpu2 with other GPUs is as follows:  
```  
gpu2 score: 100 + 200 + 200 = 500  
```  
4. The sum of scores for gpu3 with other GPUs is as follows:  
```  
gpu3 score: 200 + 100 + 200 = 500  
```  

Therefore, when a **Pod requests only one GPU**, we randomly select either **gpu0** or **gpu1**.  

###### More than one GPU

When a Pod requests multiple GPUs (more than one), the combination with the highest score is prioritized—the higher the score, the higher the scheduling priority.  

For example: If a Pod requests 3 GPUs, take **gpu0, gpu1, gpu2** as an example. The score is calculated as:  
`totalScore = score(gpu0, gpu1) + score(gpu0, gpu2) + score(gpu1, gpu2)`  

1. The score for gpu0, gpu1, gpu2 is as follows:  
```  
(gpu0, gpu1, gpu2) totalScore: 100 + 100 + 200 = 400  
```  
2. The score for gpu0, gpu1, gpu3 is as follows:  
```  
(gpu0, gpu1, gpu3) totalScore: 100 + 200 + 100 = 400  
```  
3. The score for gpu1, gpu2, gpu3 is as follows:  
```  
(gpu1, gpu2, gpu3) totalScore: 200 + 100 + 200 = 500  
```  

Therefore, when a **Pod requests 3 GPUs**, we allocate **gpu1, gpu2, gpu3**.
